# Interactive-Webpage

This is my webpage that demonstates the basics with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
The page contains a feature that tells you about your browsers information when a button is clicked. There is also a factorial calculator with validation. And there is a picture that follows
the mouse wherever you click. In addition, there is a video explanation on how the site works.
